# README

Basic repository to attempt the Stanford Question Answering Challenge to hone my
ML/Deep Learning skills.

While this repository is to hone my skills in using
[Lightning](https://lightning.ai), [Hydra](https://hydra.cc),
[WandB](https://wandb.ai/site) **AND** develop a good template following the
structure outlined in the
[lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template)
and
[yet-another-lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/gorodnitskiy/yet-another-lightning-hydra-template?ref=hackernoon.com)
templates, it will also be to explore working on the
[SQuAD2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset for
Question-Answering.

Some papers/student reports provide results that can be  used for comparison for
the performance I achieve (apart from the official leaderboard):
